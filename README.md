GeneScope - A BioPerl-based DNA Sequence Analysis Tool

📖 Project Overview

GeneScope is a menu-driven bioinformatics pipeline developed as a student project using BioPerl. It performs multiple levels of DNA sequence analysis, providing insights into genes, RNA types, exons, amino acids, metabolic pathways, and possible mutations.

This project demonstrates the use of Perl and BioPerl for biological data analysis, integrating several modules into a unified, interactive tool.

🎯 Features :

🧬 Gene Identification – Locates genes in a DNA sequence and predicts whether they may be activated or silenced.

🔬 Epigenetic Predictions – Identifies potential methylation, acetylation, and other modifications.

📑 RNA Classification – Determines if the sequence could produce mRNA, tRNA, eRNA, miRNA, or rRNA.

📦 Exon Detection & Translation – Extracts exons from mRNA and translates them into amino acid sequences.

🌐 Metabolic Pathway Mapping – Maps amino acids to their respective metabolic pathways.

🧪 Mutation & Alignment Analysis – Aligns DNA with reference sequences to detect substitutions, insertions, and deletions (INDELs).

🖥️ Menu-Driven Interface – Designed for easy step-by-step interaction.
